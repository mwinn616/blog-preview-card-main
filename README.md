## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This activity was great to practice re-sizing text elements for mobile view. Here is a snippet of the CSS I used for the text elements on the card:


```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    
 h2 {
        font-size: 1.25rem;
    }

    .description {
        font-size: 0.875rem;
    }

    .date, .label {
        font-size: 0.75rem;
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to focus in on the best way to style text elements. I used a mix of classes and semantic elements (such as h2) and curious what the best method is.
